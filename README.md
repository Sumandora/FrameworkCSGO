# FrameworkCSGO
A fully-featured training software for Counter Strike: Global Offensive, made for Linux
### WARNING: This program is being detected by Valve. Usage on official, custom or private servers will most likely result in punishment from Valve!
## Installation

Gentoo/Portage Users might want to use [this](https://github.com/Sumandora/portage-framework) ebuild repository.

### Dependencies
**Ubuntu / Debian unstable / Debian testing**

Debian stable is not supported until debian 12 releases due to outdated gcc.
```sh
apt-get install gdb git cmake make build-essential libsdl2-dev
```
**Arch Linux**
```sh
pacman -S base-devel cmake gdb git sdl2
```
**Fedora**
```sh
dnf install gdb git cmake make gcc-c++ SDL2-devel
```
These might be outdated, in that please open an issue or a pull request, which updates the package names.

### Download
Make sure to download the submodules.
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Sumandora/FrameworkCSGO.git
```

The build script can be used to build the program.
```sh
./Build.sh
```
If you want to speed up the compilation you can use multiple threads to build the program.
```sh
MAKEOPTS="-j2" ./Build.sh
```
Make sure that your CPU/Memory is capable of doing this.  
Usually memory consumption will be around twice the number of threads you provide in gigabytes.  
If you don't know how many threads you have you can execute the `nproc` program.

If you want to supply additional compiler arguments use `CXXFLAGS`
```sh
CXXFLAGS="-fstack-protector-strong ./Build.sh"
```
Some of these might break the resulting binary however.

A ELF-Binary will be built in the "Build"-subdirectory, which will be created by the script.

#### Custom library names

In case you want to build the project using a different name you can do something like this:
```sh
echo "MyCoolProjectName" > ProjectName
./Clean.sh
# Rebuild here using Debug.sh or Build.sh
```

## Usage
A simple inject script using a debugger like GDB or LLDB is provided.  
Make sure to run it as root user
```sh
./Load.sh
```
In case the default debugger (GDB) is not present, the script will error out.  
Use the `DEBUGGER` variable to set it to something you have.  
```sh
DEBUGGER=lldb ./Load.sh
```

After the script loaded the program into the game it will set the ptrace_scope to 3.  
This means that you will not be able to use ptrace after loading.  
To use ptrace again you will need to reboot.  
Please note that the program is not the only software using ptrace, it may be used widely on your system.

Make sure to use the script in a state, where the game is not changing frequently.  
- Don't inject before you can see the main menu
- Don't inject when you are loading a level

### Contribution
Contributions are welcome  
Issues and Pull Requests can help improve the program

#### Setting up a workspace (Example, your setup can differ)
- Fork the repository
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules [URL] # Replace URL with your forked repository
./Build.sh # Check for initial build errors
** Make changes **
./Debug.sh # The debug script will build and load a debug build, which can also be analyzed using a debugger of your choice

git add file1 file2 # If you added new files, you have to mark them to be tracked, if you didn't add any files, you can skip this step.
git commit -a # Make a commit with all changed files. You may have to set the 'EDITOR' variable, because you have to write a commit message. Please write a small and compact message explaining what you have done.
git push
```
You should have pushed your changes to your fork  
If you want to propose the changes in the mainline release,  
you can open a pull request on GitHub
